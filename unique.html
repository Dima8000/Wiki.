        <h3>Microcars & Bubble cars</h3>
        <p>
          Microcars were popular in the post-war era as inexpensive personal transport. They are small, light, and uniquely charming.

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Peel P50</strong> — the smallest production car ever made.</li>
          <li><strong>BMW Isetta</strong> — bubble-shaped microcar with a front-opening door.</li>
        </ul>
        


        <h3>Amphibious cars</h3>
        <p>
          Amphibious cars can operate on land and water. While niche, they showcase engineering creativity.
